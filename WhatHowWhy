----INTRODUCTION----

this calculates the probabilits of you getting at least one of your wishes when you throw n dice with f faces. Your give your wish as a tree, with "AND" and "OR" operators, and the faces that you want as leaves. 


----INTERFACE----

you can change the number of faces and dice with the corresponding "+1" and "-1" buttons. 

you can write your wish in text (see syntax) and import it with the "import user string" button

you can modify the displayed Wish tree by left clicking on the node you want to change (nedeed!) and then right clicking and following the menu. 

when the displayed tree, number of dice and faces are the one you want, just clic "calculate".


----SYNTAX----

the syntax of the tree is :
(OPERATOR;TREE;...;TREE)
where 
OPERATOR can be : AND or OR,
TREE can be : NUMBER or PRESET or (OPERATOR;TREE;...;TREE).

0-WTF is a tree?!

A tree is basically a way of writing things that a computer can understand quite well. 

if you want THING1 and THING2 and THING3, it's quite confortable for the computer if you first tell it "the next things that come, I want all of them" wich would be "AND", and then all the things you want. so :
(AND;THING1;THING2;THING3)

if you want any of these things, tell the computer "the next things that come, I want at least one of them" which would be "OR", and then the things in question. So : 
(OR;THING1;THING2;THING3)
 
 and the things you want, they could be faces, like "I want a 1 or a 5" so (OR;1;5), or more complex things. Which is the whole point : you want to be able to replace the THINGS with complex wishes in order to combine them and write for example "full house" in a way that the computer can understand.
 

1-example

let's say you want to calculate the probability of you getting a pair. You already selected 4 dice which are 6 sided. 

so you want a 1 and a 1, or a 2 and a 2, or a 3 and a 3, or a 4 and a 4. 

you would write this: 
(OR;(AND;1;1);(AND;2;2);(AND;3;3);AND(4;4))
which would be displayed like following : 
OR
--AND
----1
----1
--AND
----2
----2
--AND
----3
----3
--AND
----4
----4

2-presets

There are also some presets. for the example above, if you already selected 4 6-sided dice, you can just imput "pair", the program is goint to interpret it and construct the tree.
Avilable presets are : 

pair : two identical dice, 

full house : a pair and a triple,

n-tupel : written ntupelX with X between 3 and number of dice, it means X identical dice,

street : dice in a following order. if number of dice is smaller as number of faces, gives all possible street with this number of dice.

all dice have a certain value : written allthesameX with X the wanted value. 

tenthousand : anything valid for the game 10 000 (1 or 5 or triple or triple pair or street)
